"15"," 		Kid off to school: check. Cup of tea at hand: check. Let’s get this day started, shall we? I thought I would start the post with a retrospective of previous Days of DH that I’ve participated in, but as far as I can tell, everything before 2012 has disappeared into the ether. At any rate, here I was then. (Last year I sat the event out for various reasons.) In 2011 I was a postdoc just returning from maternity leave to my new job on the Tree of Texts project at Leuven; in 2010 I’d had my Ph.D. for just about one year, was a temporary lecturer in Byzantine history at Oxford and trying to work out what on earth I would do next. This is possibly the first year that the Day of DH has caught me “doing digital humanities” whether I like it or not. Becoming a DH professor will do that to a person, I understand. It also means that this is the first year that I will be saying anything at all about teaching, classes, students, etc. instead of talking only about my own research and hacking. On the schedule for today: Send a mail around to partners in a COST Trans-Domain Proposal we are making, due at the end of the week. Make the revisions to an abstract for the upcoming DH BeNeLux conference. Collect links to projects I’ve mentioned in the Intro to Digital Humanities seminar I’m running, and send them to the students. Plan tomorrow’s session of the Tools and Techniques for Digital Humanities class. Finish the data analysis for an article I am writing. So let’s get on with it!

"18"," 		Morning everyone! 2 in 1: a nice coffee and a thought for the day. My first #DayofDH is looking busy, but I’m looking forward to that. Starting with reading some news, emails and off to conquer the #dh world shortly, or rather give it a try:-) Happy #DayofDH morning everyone! P.S. First time posted via my iPhone, what a handy little thing it is!  	","April 8, 2014 7:47 am","karolinabadz","http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/karolinabadz/2014/04/08/"
"22"," 			My Day of DH begins before the Day of DH even begins. Late into the night of April 7, I am up preparing a blog post–and not just for the Day of DH. I’m a contributor to a group blog on American religious history (my field) titled, quite obviously, Religion in American History. Founded in 2007 by historian Paul Harvey, a scholar whose generosity is only matched by his energy, the blog is now almost 7 years old and is about to publish its 2500th post. Over thirty contributors follow a monthly calendar to generate content and my day is, fortuitously, today. For me, defining DH begins with trying to encapsulate the longevity and the energy behind a scholarly blog like RiAH. Most, indeed, all of the contributors would likely not classify themselves as DHers. But here they are, augmenting existing scholarly networks, crafting new genres of scholarly writing, and fostering new kinds of academic relationships through a mode of digital communication less than two decades old. My Day of DH is busy. Today I’ll be having a phone call with a web developer to get an update on a map-based digital exhibit I am building; I’ll be curating the items for this exhibit and sending them off to the scanner for digitization; I’ll continue working on a report I am writing for a scholarly association on how  new media is affecting how knowledge about religion is produced, shared, and authorized; I’ll edit the blog posts of the interns I supervise in UMKC’s history department; and this evening I’ll teach a session of my Intro to Digital History class, where we’ll discuss the use of GIS software for historical analysis. But when I think about what exactly the Digital Humanities are, I keep coming back to RiAH and the ways in which digital technology has permanently transformed how scholars everywhere research, teach, and communicate scholarship. In short, in the same way no one in Chemistry talks about doing “Digital Chemistry” because they use statistical computer software, there is a part of me that is coming to realize that we may be approaching a point where the saturation digital humanities tools (from blogging platforms to searchable databases) is making everyone a Digital Humanist. To be sure, not everyone will do advanced text mining or network analysis. And nor should they. But the more I see the distinction between reblogs and footnotes disintegrate as writes cite blog posts, I can’t help be think DH is in some new defining phase that is less about DH’s relationship to the humanities and more about the humanities’ relationship to the digital turn. Want to get a sense of what I mean about this broader phase? Head on over to the Religion in American History blog. I’ve decided to make my first Day of DH post my monthly post for RiAH, and I’ve asked readers to comment on the post to tell us just what exactly the blog means to them and how they use it. Their answers might be of interest to other Day of DH folks. Collaborative. Interconnected. Discursive. This, to me, is DH.       					","April 8, 2014","cdc29","http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/cdc29/2014/04/08/"
"23"," 			8 am Ok here we go. Ordinary child care and ablutions set aside, this day of DH starts with a little data crunching. R and Perl wishing me a good Day of DH My computer has been running all night to deliver good results this morning: it looks like the method I’m working on (with Guillaume Guex) actually makes for a more robust measurement of inflectional diversity. Sounds to me like the beginning of an excellent Day of DH.   					","April 8, 2014","axanthos","http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/axanthos/2014/04/08/"
"24"," 		This year, I plan to gather here a series of posts from my blog, cplong.org, and other digital content related to various facets of my academic and administrative life that I take, broadly speaking, to be associated with the Digital Humanities. My definition of digital humanities is brief and expansive: the digitally mediated practice of the Humanities. This articulation advocates for the humanities itself as a practice. More than a set of disciplines, the humanities is an endeavor: the ongoing attempt to act and think in ways that do justice to the complexity of humanity so as to enrich human culture and community. As mediated by the digital, this endeavor takes on new, powerful capacities of publicness and collaboration, even if it also runs the risk of losing itself in a vast sea of data with its cross-currents of disconnected information. My work in the digital humanities includes but extends beyond my academic scholarship in Philosophy to my work in higher education administration and ultimately to my family and personal life where digital media enable me to cultivate habits of mindfulness. With this definition in hand, I include in my Long Day of DH 2014 posts about my academic and administrative life punctuated by moments of mindfulness designed to remind us that it is the human that brings the digital to life. So, today you will find posts on: Digital Scholarship Open Access Public Writing The Administrative Life The Graduate Experience Mindfulness ","April 8, 2014","cplong","http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/cplong/2014/04/08/"
"30"," 		 Hi! My name is Jim McGrath, and this is my first year participating in Day of DH! I wanted to check in to lay out what visitors might expect from my particular contribution to this project. Here’s what passes for tomorrow’s agenda (as of 11:10pm on Monday): -I’ll be spending most of the day at The Eighth Annual Digital Commonwealth Conference, hosted this year by The College of The Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. Specifically, I’ll be speaking about Our Marathon: The Boston Bombing Digital Archive with my friend and co-worker Dave DeCamp at an afternoon session on “Audience Engagement and Crowdsourcing” (where we’ll be joined by the wonderful Alyssa Pacy of The Cambridge Public Library). Most of my day will be spent in Worcester attending various sessions (like the morning session called “Online Exhibits: From Paper to Published,” which will feature Our Marathon Co-Director Alicia Peaker). -This is a particularly busy week for Our Marathon, as we’re quickly approaching the one year anniversary of last year’s tragic events. A large portion of the day will be spent on various Our Marathon duties: checking the site for new contributions (have you shared your story with us?), planning upcoming “Share Your Story” events at The Boston Public Library and The Pollard Library in Lowell, finalizing details on an Our Marathon exhibit that opens at Northeastern on Thursday, checking in with new team members working on our Boston City Archives acquisitions, checking in with the amazing oral historians working on The WBUR Oral History Project (segments of which you may have heard on WBUR), responding to various e-mails, and  doing a bit of social media outreach. Part of today was spent at the opening of the “Dear Boston” exhibit at The BPL, which is really amazing: learn more about the project here and here. -If I have time (fingers crossed), I may get some TEI work done for Digital Humanities Quarterly, as I’m presently their bibliographic developer. I also need to prep for a meeting with Julia Flanders on Wednesday, where we’ll be talking about my proposal for this year’s TEI Conference. -I’ll also be Tweeting about Day of DH, the conference, and Our Marathon (among other topics)  @JimMc_Grath.  If I have time, I may be able to see if there are any updates from my good buddy @CK1Blogs. If I REALLY have time, I might even get to ‘Gram a bit from Worcester! Looking forward to my first Day of DH! Now it’s time for me to make sure all of my DH tools (phone, laptop, Kindle) are charged and ready to roll for tomorrow! Night!

"32"," 		Hi everyone! I’m Anastasia Salter (@anasalter), an assistant professor at the University of Baltimore.  I decided to jump in at the last minute this year to chronicle some of my new experiences now that I’m balancing an administrative role (graduate program director) with being on the tenure track researching and teaching in games and digital media. I’m also in the middle of a Game a Week challenge with a cohort of designers & academics. My “Day of Digital Humanities” really begins now, at midnight, as I wrap up my online class and the administrative activities that follow. At my university, our teaching schedule is designed for the convenience of students who often work full-time, and thus my graduate Information Culture course meets from 8:15 to 10:45 PM every Monday night.  When I first started, this was a challenge for me as I am not a night owl. However, a few years in it’s a lot easier, and the advantage of teaching online (without the 30 minute drive to follow) should mean ending my nights relatively on time. Unfortunately, I am always so revved up from teaching (fandom and Kickstarter! racism in World of Warcraft! gold farming and invisible labor! — just a few of tonight’s highlights) that I can never actually go to bed immediately after class. This week is particularly unusual as I’m on my way home from the Foundations of Digital Games conference, where I just co-presented on gender in game development communities and the future of HTML5 as a platform for web arcades. Thus I taught my online course from a hotel room here in Ft. Lauderdale, complete with all the technological limitations inherent in my set-up: a fire alarm went off halfway through class, and the audio gave out a few times, but we otherwise continued our discussion of invisible and undervalued labor in online communities relatively unscathed. Here’s a picture of my fabulous workspace for the evening: After teaching, I normally end the day (and begin the next) by recording attendance, making notes on participation and ideas I want to follow-up on both to support individual students in their research and refine my plans for next week’s discussion, replying to email follow-ups or staying “virtually” present to have private conversations with students, and generally decompressing. As I’ve written about on ProfHacker, this is my first fully online course, so I’m also keeping track of my own pedagogical decisions and how they play out each week. It’s definitely harder to know how well students are doing at keeping awake and engaged this late at night when I’m meeting with them online, so I am always working on strategies to increase engagement and vary the pace and media of our discussions. With that type of administrative and reflective work out of the way tonight, I know I can start up tomorrow and move to preparing for my Wednesday class and working on other projects.

"103"," 		Taipei, Taiwan. It’s 12:01 am, Tuesday, Apr. 8, 2014: Day of DH. I think I might be the first to post this year, unless some other DHer in Japan, Australia, or somewhere else to the East of East beat me to it. Too bad I have nothing exciting to report, just a Chinese language textbook, a 0.9mm Pentel P209, and a well-worn non-latex eraser. What is DH? Is it this?
